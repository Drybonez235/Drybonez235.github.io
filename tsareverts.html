            <h2>Tsareverts Castle</h2>   
            <p>Tsareverts Castle was a fortress that housed Bulgaria's royalty from the 10th - 14th centries. Located on a hill, the bridge and wall provided the perfect stronghold to deter enemies from invading or trying to overthrow the monarchy. Today, you can still visit the fortress, climb to the top, and tour the keep. Inside the keep, there are many old paintings from the time period that the fortress was in use.</p>

                <p>The Fortress had a long bridge that you had to cross in order to get to the path leading up to the top. While there was no draw bridge, this bridge would be incredibly difficult to cross while invading. </p>

                <p>While we often imagine castles and fortresses having a huge wall around it, in the past people used hills and mountains to supplement wall size. This castle was built on a hill and was already difficult to attack and so adding walls ensured that the royals of ancient Bulgaria were protected.</p>
