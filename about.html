                <h2>Jonathan Lewis</h2>  
                <p>My name is Jonathan Lewis and currently I am student studying computer science. I am in a phase of my life where I am trying to transition careers from health coach to data analyst. I already have one degree in exercise science but am bolstering my resume by adding an advanced certificate of software developemnt from Wright college. I have been married for 4 years this December to my wife, Lydia</p>

                <h3>Destination</h3>
                <p>I have been to many places outside of the United States including Cuba, Panama, Brazil, Mexico, Canada, and Bulgaria. The reason I chose Bulgaria was because that is the country I have the best pictures from and saw the most things.</p>
