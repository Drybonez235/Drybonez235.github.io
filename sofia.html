            <h2>Sofia</h2>   
            <p>Sofia is the capital of Bulgaria. I was able to explore this city and see many famous sites! Sofia is one of the most popular cities to visit when in Bulgaria simply because of the long history that the city holds. In Europe, most cities were established hundreds of years ago and have slowly evolved with new technological inovations. An example of this is city streets. Most streets are narrow and ideal for walking or horse and carriges, but not well suited for modern cars. Parking is hard to find!</p>

                <p>I have eaten at a McDonalds in almost every foreign country I have visited. At this location they actually had a McFlurry that had Rolos as the topping! It is interesting to see how the building is historic contrasted with the standard McDonalds in the United States that have their own buildings.</p>
