            <h2>My Trip To Bulgaria</h2>  
            <p>In the summer of 2017 I, along with a group of other college students went to Bulgaria. We went to help a local church with their summer youth program. The program ran for a week focused on choir and vocal performance. In all, 18 children particpated in the program.</p>
            <p>While in Bulgaria, we stayed in Varna but we were able to visit Sophia, Nessbar, and Tsareverts Fortress.</p>
            <p>This website will take you on a tour a few of these places and show you a few of the sites I got to experience!</p>
